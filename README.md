# McJsonizeIt

McJsonizeIt is a Python-based tool providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for converting JSON files into JSONL (JSON Lines) format. The GUI is built with Tkinter and styled with `ttkbootstrap` using a tropical theme. It allows you to select an input JSON file and an output folder, with automatic name conflict handling and a progress bar for visual feedback during conversion.
